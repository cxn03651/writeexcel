  # The name() method is used to retrieve the name of a worksheet. For example:
  #
  #     workbook.sheets.each do |sheet|
  #         print sheet.name
  #     end
  #
  # For reasons related to the design of WriteExcel and to the internals of
  # Excel there is no set_name() method. The only way to set the worksheet
  # name is via the add_worksheet() method.
  #
  def name
    @name
  end

  #
  # Set this worksheet as a selected worksheet, i.e. the worksheet has its tab
  # highlighted.
  #
  # The select() method is used to indicate that a worksheet is selected in a
  # multi-sheet workbook:
  #
  #     worksheet1.activate
  #     worksheet2.select
  #     worksheet3.select
  #
  # A selected worksheet has its tab highlighted. Selecting worksheets is a way
  # of grouping them together so that, for example, several worksheets could be
  # printed in one go. A worksheet that has been activated via the activate()
  # method will also appear as selected.
  #
  def select
    @hidden   = false  # Selected worksheet can't be hidden.
    @selected = true
  end


  #
  # Set this worksheet as the active worksheet, i.e. the worksheet that is
  # displayed when the workbook is opened. Also set it as selected.
  #
  # The activate() method is used to specify which worksheet is initially
  # visible in a multi-sheet workbook:
  #
  #     worksheet1 = workbook.add_worksheet('To')
  #     worksheet2 = workbook.add_worksheet('the')
  #     worksheet3 = workbook.add_worksheet('wind')
  #
  #     worksheet3.activate
  #
  # This is similar to the Excel VBA activate method. More than one worksheet
  # can be selected via the select() method, see below, however only one
  # worksheet can be active.
  #
  # The default active worksheet is the first worksheet.
  #
  def activate
    @hidden   = false  # Active worksheet can't be hidden.
    @selected = true
    @workbook.worksheets.activesheet = self
  end


  #
  # Hide this worksheet.
  #
  # The hide() method is used to hide a worksheet:
  #
  #     worksheet2.hide
  #
  # You may wish to hide a worksheet in order to avoid confusing a user with
  # intermediate data or calculations.
  #
  # A hidden worksheet can not be activated or selected so this method is
  # mutually exclusive with the activate() and select() methods. In addition,
  # since the first worksheet will default to being the active worksheet,
  # you cannot hide the first worksheet without activating another sheet:
  #
  #     worksheet2.activate
  #     worksheet1.hide
  #
  def hide(hidden = :hidden)
    @hidden = hidden

    # A hidden worksheet shouldn't be active or selected.
    @selected  = false
    @workbook.worksheets.activesheet = @workbook.worksheets.first
    @workbook.worksheets.firstsheet  = @workbook.worksheets.first
  end


  #
  # Set this worksheet as the first visible sheet. This is necessary
  # when there are a large number of worksheets and the activated
  # worksheet is not visible on the screen.
  #
  # The activate() method determines which worksheet is initially selected.
  # However, if there are a large number of worksheets the selected worksheet
  # may not appear on the screen. To avoid this you can select which is the
  # leftmost visible worksheet using set_first_sheet
  #
  #     20.times { workbook.add_worksheet }
  #
  #     worksheet21 = workbook.add_worksheet
  #     worksheet22 = workbook.add_worksheet
  #
  #     worksheet21.set_first_sheet
  #     worksheet22.activate
  #
  # This method is not required very often. The default value is the first
  # worksheet.
  #
  def set_first_sheet
    @hidden = false        # Active worksheet can't be hidden.
    @workbook.worksheets.firstsheet = self
  end

  #
  # Set the worksheet protection flag to prevent accidental modification and to
  # hide formulas if the locked and hidden format properties have been set.
  #
  # The protect() method is used to protect a worksheet from modification:
  #
  #     worksheet.protect
  #
  # It can be turned off in Excel via the
  # Tools->Protection->Unprotect Sheet menu command.
  #
  # The protect() method also has the effect of enabling a cell's locked and
  # hidden properties if they have been set. A "locked" cell cannot be edited.
  # A "hidden" cell will display the results of a formula but not the formula
  # itself. In Excel a cell's locked property is on by default.
  #
  #     # Set some format properties
  #     unlocked  = workbook.add_format(:locked => 0)
  #     hidden    = workbook.add_format(:hidden => 1)
  #
  #     # Enable worksheet protection
  #     worksheet.protect
  #
  #     # This cell cannot be edited, it is locked by default
  #     worksheet.write('A1', '=1+2')
  #
  #     # This cell can be edited
  #     worksheet.write('A2', '=1+2', unlocked)
  #
  #     # The formula in this cell isn't visible
  #     worksheet.write('A3', '=1+2', hidden)
  #
  # See also the set_locked and set_hidden format methods in "CELL FORMATTING".
  #
  # You can optionally add a password to the worksheet protection:
  #
  #     worksheet.protect('drowssap')
  #
  # Note,
  #
  #  the worksheet level password in Excel provides very weak protection. It
  # does not encrypt your data in any way and it is very easy to deactivate.
  # Therefore, do not use the above method if you wish to protect sensitive
  # data or calculations. However, before you get worried, Excel's own
  # workbook level password protection does provide strong encryption in
  # Excel 97+. For technical reasons this will never be supported by
  # WriteExcel.
  #
  def protect(password = nil)
    @protect   = true
    @password  = encode_password(password) if password
  end

  #          row       : Row Number
  #          height    : Format object

  #          collapsed : Collapsed row
  #
  # This method is used to set the height and XF format for a row.
  # Writes the  BIFF record ROW.
  #
  # This method can be used to change the default properties of a row. All
  # parameters apart from _row_ are optional.
  #
  # The most common use for this method is to change the height of a row:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(0, 20) # Row 1 height set to 20
  #
  # If you wish to set the _format_ without changing the _height_ you can pass
  # nil as the _height_ parameter:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(0, nil, format)
  #
  # The _format_ parameter will be applied to any cells in the row that don't
  # have a format. For example
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(0, nil, format1)      # Set the format for row 1
  #     worksheet.write('A1', 'Hello')          # Defaults to format1
  #     worksheet.write('B1', 'Hello', format2) # Keeps format2
  #
  # If you wish to define a row format in this way you should call the method
  # before any calls to write(). Calling it afterwards will overwrite any format
  # that was previously specified.
  #
  # The hidden parameter should be set to true if you wish to hide a row. This can
  # be used, for example, to hide intermediary steps in a complicated calculation:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(0, 20,  format, true)
  #     worksheet.set_row(1, nil, nil,    true)
  #
  # The level parameter is used to set the outline level of the row. Outlines
  # are described in "OUTLINES AND GROUPING IN EXCEL". Adjacent rows with the
  # same outline level are grouped together into a single outline.
  #
  # The following example sets an outline level of 1 for rows 1 and 2
  # (zero-indexed):
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(1, nil, nil, false, 1)
  #     worksheet.set_row(2, nil, nil, false, 1)
  #
  # The hidden parameter can also be used to hide collapsed outlined rows when
  # used in conjunction with the level parameter.
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(1, nil, nil, true, 1)
  #     worksheet.set_row(2, nil, nil, true, 1)
  #
  # For collapsed outlines you should also indicate which row has the
  # collapsed + symbol using the optional collapsed parameter.
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(3, nil, nil, false, 0, true)
  #
  # For a more complete example see the outline.pl and outline_collapsed.rb
  # programs in the examples directory of the distro.
  #
  # Excel allows up to 7 outline levels. Therefore the level parameter should
  # be in the range 0 <= level <= 7.

  #   set_column(A1_notation,         width, format, hidden, level, collapsed)
  #
  # Set the width of a single column or a range of columns.
  #--
  # See also: store_colinfo
  #++
  #
  # This method can be used to change the default properties of a single
  # column or a range of columns. All parameters apart from _first_col_ and
  # _last_col_ are optional.
  #
  # If set_column() is applied to a single column the value of _first_col_ and
  # _last_col_ should be the same. In the case where _last_col_ is zero it is
  # set to the same value as _first_col_.
  #
  # It is also possible, and generally clearer, to specify a column range
  # using the form of A1 notation used for columns. See the note about
  # "Cell notation".
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_column(0, 0,  20) # Column  A   width set to 20
  #     worksheet.set_column(1, 3,  30) # Columns B-D width set to 30
  #     worksheet.set_column('E:E', 20) # Column  E   width set to 20
  #     worksheet.set_column('F:H', 30) # Columns F-H width set to 30
  #
  # The width corresponds to the column width value that is specified in Excel.
  # It is approximately equal to the length of a string in the default font
  # of Arial 10. Unfortunately, there is no way to specify "AutoFit" for a
  # column in the Excel file format. This feature is only available at
  # runtime from within Excel.
  #
  # As usual the _format_ parameter is optional, for additional information,
  # see "CELL FORMATTING". If you wish to set the format without changing the
  # width you can pass undef as the width parameter:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_column(0, 0, nil, format)
  #
  # The _format_ parameter will be applied to any cells in the column that
  # don't have a format. For example
  #
  #     worksheet.set_column('A:A', nil, format1)   # Set format for col 1
  #     worksheet.write('A1', 'Hello')              # Defaults to format1
  #     worksheet.write('A2', 'Hello', format2)     # Keeps format2
  #
  # If you wish to define a column format in this way you should call the
  # method before any calls to write(). If you call it afterwards it won't
  # have any effect.
  #
  # A default row format takes precedence over a default column format
  #
  #     worksheet.set_row(0, nil,        format1)   # Set format for row 1
  #     worksheet.set_column('A:A', nil, format2)   # Set format for col 1
  #     worksheet.write('A1', 'Hello')              # Defaults to format1
  #     worksheet.write('A2', 'Hello')              # Defaults to format2
  #
  # The _hidden_ parameter should be set to true if you wish to hide a column.
  # This can be used, for example, to hide intermediary steps in a complicated

  # regions known as panes and to also "freeze" these panes so that the
  # splitter bars are not visible. This is the same as the Window->Freeze Panes
  # menu command in Excel
  #
  # The parameters _row_ and _col_ are used to specify the location of the split.
  # It should be noted that the split is specified at the top or left of a
  # cell and that the method uses zero based indexing. Therefore to freeze the
  # first row of a worksheet it is necessary to specify the split at row 2
  # (which is 1 as the zero-based index). This might lead you to think that
  # you are using a 1 based index but this is not the case.
  #
  # You can set one of the _row_ and _col_ parameters as zero if you do not
  # want either a vertical or horizontal split.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #     worksheet.freeze_panes(1, 0)  # Freeze the first row
  #     worksheet.freeze_panes('A2')  # Same using A1 notation
  #     worksheet.freeze_panes(0, 1)  # Freeze the first column

  #     worksheet.freeze_panes(1, 2)  # Freeze first row and first 2 columns
  #     worksheet.freeze_panes('C2')  # Same using A1 notation
  #
  # The parameters _top_row_ and _left_col_ are optional. They are used to

  # region of the panes. For example to freeze the first row and to have the
  # scrolling region begin at row twenty:
  #
  #     worksheet.freeze_panes(1, 0, 20, 0)

  #
  # This method can be used to divide a worksheet into horizontal or vertical

  # method in that the splits between the panes will be visible to the user
  # and each pane will have its own scroll bars.
  #
  # The parameters _y_ and _x_ are used to specify the vertical and horizontal
  # position of the split. The units for _y_ and _x_ are the same as those
  # used by Excel to specify row height and column width. However, the
  # vertical and horizontal units are different from each other. Therefore you
  # must specify the _y_ and _x_ parameters in terms of the row heights and
  # column widths that you have set or the default values which are 12.75 for
  # a row and 8.43 for a column.
  #
  # You can set one of the _y_ and _x_ parameters as zero if you do not want
  # either a vertical or horizontal split. The parameters _top_row_ and
  # _left_col_ are optional. They are used to specify the top-most or
  # left-most visible row or column in the bottom-right pane.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     worksheet.split_panes(12.75, 0,    1, 0)  # First row

  #
  # <em>WARNING.</em> The format object that is used with a merge_range()
  # method call is marked internally as being associated with a merged range.
  # It is a fatal error to use a merged format in a non-merged cell. Instead
  # you should use separate formats for merged and non-merged cells. This
  # restriction will be removed in a future release.
  #
  # The _utf_16_be_ parameter is optional, see below.
  #
  # merge_range() writes its _token_ argument using the worksheet write()

  # NOTE:
  # It isn't sufficient to just specify the filter condition. You must also

  #     worksheet.filter_column('B', 'x > 2000 and x < 5000')
  #

  #        <
  #        >=
  #        <=
  #
  #        and          &&
  #        or           ||
  #
  # The operator synonyms are just syntactic sugar to make you more comfortable
  # using the expressions. It is important to remember that the expressions will
  # be interpreted by Excel and not by ruby.
  #
  # An expression can comprise a single statement or two statements separated by
  # the and and or operators. For example:
  #
  #     'x <  2000'
  #     'x >  2000'
  #     'x == 2000'
  #     'x >  2000 and x <  5000'
  #     'x == 2000 or  x == 5000'
  #
  # Filtering of blank or non-blank data can be achieved by using a value of
  # Blanks or NonBlanks in the expression:
  #
  #     'x == Blanks'
  #     'x == NonBlanks'
  #
  # Top 10 style filters can be specified using a expression like the
  # following:
  #
  #     Top|Bottom 1-500 Items|%
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     'Top    10 Items'
  #     'Bottom  5 Items'
  #     'Top    25 %'
  #     'Bottom 50 %'
  #
  # Excel also allows some simple string matching operations:
  #
  #     'x =~ b*'   # begins with b
  #     'x !~ b*'   # doesn't begin with b
  #     'x =~ *b'   # ends with b
  #     'x !~ *b'   # doesn't end with b
  #     'x =~ *b*'  # contains b
  #     'x !~ *b*'  # doesn't contains b
  #
  # You can also use * to match any character or number and ? to match any
  # single character or number. No other regular expression quantifier is
  # supported by Excel's filters. Excel's regular expression characters can
  # be escaped using ~.
  #
  # The placeholder variable x in the above examples can be replaced by any
  # simple string. The actual placeholder name is ignored internally so the
  # following are all equivalent:
  #
  #     'x     < 2000'
  #     'col   < 2000'
  #     'Price < 2000'
  #

  # You can specify the font size of a section of the text by prefixing it
  # with the control character &n where n is the font size:
  #
  #     worksheet1.set_header('&C&30Hello Big'  )
  #     worksheet2.set_header('&C&10Hello Small')
  #
  # You can specify the font of a section of the text by prefixing it with the
  # control sequence &"font,style" where fontname is a font name such as
  # "Courier New" or "Times New Roman" and style is one of the standard Windows
  # font descriptions: "Regular", "Italic", "Bold" or "Bold Italic":
  #
  #     worksheet1.set_header('&C&"Courier New,Italic"Hello')
  #     worksheet2.set_header('&C&"Courier New,Bold Italic"Hello')
  #     worksheet3.set_header('&C&"Times New Roman,Regular"Hello')
  #
  # It is possible to combine all of these features together to create
  # sophisticated headers and footers. As an aid to setting up complicated
  # headers and footers you can record a page set-up as a macro in Excel and
  # look at the format strings that VBA produces. Remember however that VBA uses
  # two double quotes "" to indicate a single double quote. For the last example
  # above the equivalent VBA code looks like this:
  #
  #     .LeftHeader   = ""
  #     .CenterHeader = "&""Times New Roman,Regular""Hello"
  #     .RightHeader  = ""
  #
  # To include a single literal ampersand & in a header or footer you should
  # use a double ampersand &&:
  #
  #     worksheet1.set_header('&CCuriouser && Curiouser - Attorneys at Law')
  #
  # As stated above the margin parameter is optional. As with the other margins
  # the value should be in inches. The default header and footer margin is 0.50
  # inch. The header and footer margin size can be set as follows:
  #
  #     worksheet.set_header('&CHello', 0.75)
  #
  # The header and footer margins are independent of the top and bottom margins.
  #
  # Note, the header or footer string must be less than 255 characters. Strings
  # longer than this will not be written and a warning will be generated.
  #
  #     worksheet.set_header("&C\x{263a}")
  #
  # See, also the headers.rb program in the examples directory of the
  # distribution.
  #

  # Causes the write() method to treat integers with a leading zero as a string.
  # This ensures that any leading zeros such, as in zip codes, are maintained.
  #
  # This method changes the default handling of integers with leading zeros
  # when using the write() method.
  #
  # The write() method uses regular expressions to determine what type of data
  # to write to an Excel worksheet. If the data looks like a number it writes
  # a number using write_number(). One problem with this approach is that
  # occasionally data looks like a number but you don't want it treated as
  # a number.
  #
  # Zip codes and ID numbers, for example, often start with a leading zero.
  # If you write this data as a number then the leading zero(s) will be
  # stripped. This is the also the default behaviour when you enter data
  # manually in Excel.
  #
  # To get around this you can use one of three options. Write a formatted
  # number, write the number as a string or use the keep_leading_zeros()
  # method to change the default behaviour of write():
  #
  #    # Implicitly write a number, the leading zero is removed: 1209
  #    worksheet.write('A1', '01209')
  #
  #    # Write a zero padded number using a format: 01209
  #    format1 = workbook.add_format(:num_format => '00000')
  #    worksheet.write('A2', '01209', format1)
  #
  #    # Write explicitly as a string: 01209
  #    worksheet.write_string('A3', '01209')
  #
  #    # Write implicitly as a string: 01209
  #    worksheet.keep_leading_zeros()
  #    worksheet.write('A4', '01209')
  #
  # The above code would generate a worksheet that looked like the following:
  #
  #     -----------------------------------------------------------
  #    |   |     A     |     B     |     C     |     D     | ...
  #     -----------------------------------------------------------
  #    | 1 |      1209 |           |           |           | ...
  #    | 2 |     01209 |           |           |           | ...
  #    | 3 | 01209     |           |           |           | ...
  #    | 4 | 01209     |           |           |           | ...
  #
  # The examples are on different sides of the cells due to the fact that Excel
  # displays strings with a left justification and numbers with a right
  # justification by default. You can change this by using a format to justify
  # the data, see "CELL FORMATTING".
  #
  # It should be noted that if the user edits the data in examples A3 and A4
  # the strings will revert back to numbers. Again this is Excel's default
  # behaviour. To avoid this you can use the text format @:
  #
  #    # Format as a string (01209)
  #    format2 = workbook.add_format(:num_format => '@')
  #    worksheet.write_string('A5', '01209', format2)
  #
  # The keep_leading_zeros() property is off by default. The keep
  #_leading_zeros() method takes 0 or 1 as an argument. It defaults to 1 if
  # an argument isn't specified:
  #
  #    worksheet.keep_leading_zeros()  # Set on
  #    worksheet.keep_leading_zeros(1) # Set on
  #    worksheet.keep_leading_zeros(0) # Set off
  #
  # See also the add_write_handler() method.
  #
  def keep_leading_zeros(val = true)
    @leading_zeros = val
  end

  #
  # Make any comments in the worksheet visible.
  #
  # This method is used to make all cell comments visible when a worksheet is
  # opened.
  #
  # Individual comments can be made visible using the visible parameter of the
  # write_comment method (see above):
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :visible => 1)
  #
  # If all of the cell comments have been made visible you can hide individual
  # comments as follows:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :visible => 0)
  #
  #
  def show_comments(val = true)
    @comments.visible = val ? true : false
  end

  #
  # Set the start page number.
  #
  # The set_start_page() method is used to set the number of the starting page
  # when the worksheet is printed out. The default value is 1.
  #
  #     worksheet.set_start_page(2)
  #
  def set_start_page(start_page = 1)
    @page_start    = start_page
    @custom_start  = 1

  #
  # Allow the user to add their own matches and handlers to the write() method.
  #
  # This method is used to extend the WriteExcel write() method to handle user
  # defined data.
  #
  # If you refer to the section on write() above you will see that it acts as an
  # alias for several more specific write_* methods. However, it doesn't always
  # act in exactly the way that you would like it to.
  #
  # One solution is to filter the input data yourself and call the appropriate
  # write_* method. Another approach is to use the add_write_handler() method
  # to add your own automated behaviour to write().
  #
  # The add_write_handler() method take two arguments, _re_, a regular
  # expression to match incoming data and _code_ a callback function to handle
  # the matched data:
  #
  #     worksheet.add_write_handler(qr/^\d\d\d\d$/, \&my_write)
  #
  # (In the these examples the qr operator is used to quote the regular expression
  # strings, see perlop for more details).
  #
  # The method is used as follows. say you wished to write 7 digit ID numbers as
  # a string so that any leading zeros were preserved*, you could do something
  # like the following:
  #
  #     worksheet.add_write_handler(qr/^\d{7}$/, \&write_my_id)
  #
  #     sub write_my_id {
  #         my $worksheet = shift;
  #         return $worksheet->write_string(@_);
  #     }
  #
  # * You could also use the keep_leading_zeros() method for this.
  #
  # Then if you call write() with an appropriate string it will be handled automatically:
  #
  #     # Writes 0000000. It would normally be written as a number; 0.
  #     $worksheet->write('A1', '0000000');
  #
  # The callback function will receive a reference to the calling worksheet
  # and all of the other arguments that were passed to write(). The callback
  # will see an @_ argument list that looks like the following:
  #
  #     $_[0]   A ref to the calling worksheet. *
  #     $_[1]   Zero based row number.
  #     $_[2]   Zero based column number.
  #     $_[3]   A number or string or token.
  #     $_[4]   A format ref if any.
  #     $_[5]   Any other arguments.
  #     ...
  #
  #     *  It is good style to shift this off the list so the @_ is the same
  #        as the argument list seen by write().
  #
  # Your callback should return() the return value of the write_* method that
  # was called or undef to indicate that you rejected the match and want
  # write() to continue as normal.
  #
  # So for example if you wished to apply the previous filter only to ID
  # values that occur in the first column you could modify your callback
  # function as follows:
  #
  #     sub write_my_id {
  #         my $worksheet = shift;
  #         my $col       = $_[1];
  #
  #         if ($col == 0) {
  #             return $worksheet->write_string(@_);
  #         }
  #         else {
  #             # Reject the match and return control to write()
  #             return undef;
  #         }
  #     }
  #
  # Now, you will get different behaviour for the first column and other
  # columns:
  #
  #     $worksheet->write('A1', '0000000'); # Writes 0000000
  #     $worksheet->write('B1', '0000000'); # Writes 0
  #
  # You may add more than one handler in which case they will be called in the
  # order that they were added.
  #
  # Note, the add_write_handler() method is particularly suited for handling
  # dates.
  #
  # See the write_handler 1-4 programs in the examples directory for further
  # examples.
  #
  #++
#  def add_write_handler(regexp, code_ref)
#    #       return unless ref $_[1] eq 'CODE';
#
#    @write_match.push([regexp, code_ref])
#  end

  #
  # :call-seq:
  #   write(row, col,    token, format)
  #   write(A1_notation, token, format)
  #
  # Parse token and call appropriate write method. row and column are zero
  # indexed. format is optional.
  #
  # The write_url() methods have a flag to prevent recursion when writing a
  # string that looks like a url.
  #
  # Returns: return value of called subroutine
  #
  #
  # Excel makes a distinction between data types such as strings, numbers,
  # blanks, formulas and hyperlinks. To simplify the process of writing
  # data the write() method acts as a general alias for several more
  # specific methods:
  #    write_string()
  #    write_number()
  #    write_blank()
  #    write_formula()
  #    write_url()
  #    write_row()
  #    write_col()
  #
  # The general rule is that if the data looks like a something then a
  # something is written. Here are some examples in both row-column
  # and A1 notation:
  #                                                         # Same as:
  #    worksheet.write(0, 0, 'Hello'                     )  # write_string()
  #    worksheet.write(1, 0, 'One'                       )  # write_string()
  #    worksheet.write(2, 0,  2                          )  # write_number()
  #    worksheet.write(3, 0,  3.00001                    )  # write_number()
  #    worksheet.write(4, 0,  ""                         )  # write_blank()
  #    worksheet.write(5, 0,  ''                         )  # write_blank()
  #    worksheet.write(6, 0,  nil                        )  # write_blank()
  #    worksheet.write(7, 0                              )  # write_blank()
  #    worksheet.write(8, 0,  'http://www.ruby-lang.org/')  # write_url()
  #    worksheet.write('A9',  'ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/' )  # write_url()
  #    worksheet.write('A10', 'internal:Sheet1!A1'       )  # write_url()
  #    worksheet.write('A11', 'external:c:\foo.xls'      )  # write_url()
  #    worksheet.write('A12', '=A3 + 3*A4'               )  # write_formula()
  #    worksheet.write('A13', '=SIN(PI()/4)'             )  # write_formula()
  #    worksheet.write('A14', ['name', 'company']        )  # write_row()
  #    worksheet.write('A15', [ ['name', 'company'] ]    )  # write_col()
  #
  # And if the keep_leading_zeros property is set:
  #  $worksheet.write('A16,  2                     ); # write_number()
  #    $worksheet.write('A17,  02                    ); # write_string()
  #    $worksheet.write('A18,  00002                 ); # write_string()
  #
  # The "looks like" rule is defined by regular expressions:
  #
  # * write_number() if _token_ is a number based on the following regex:
  #   token =~ /^([+-]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+-]?\d+))?$/.
  #
  # * write_string() if keep_leading_zeros() is set and _token_ is an integer
  #   with leading zeros based on the following regex: token =~ /^0\d+$/.
  #
  # * write_blank() if _token_ is undef or a blank string: undef, "" or ''.
  #
  # * write_url() if _token_ is a http, https, ftp or mailto URL based on the
  #   following regexes: token =~ m|^[fh]tt?ps?://| or $token =~ m|^mailto:|.
  #
  # * write_url() if _token_ is an internal or external sheet reference based
  #   on the following regex: token =~ m[^(in|ex)ternal:].
  #
  # * write_formula() if the first character of _token_ is "=".
  #
  # * write_row() if _token_ is an array.
  #
  # * write_col() if _token+ is an array of array.
  #
  # * write_string() if none of the previous conditions apply.
  #
  # The format parameter is optional. It should be a valid Format object, see
  # "CELL FORMATTING":
  #
  #    format = workbook.add_format
  #    format.set_bold
  #    format.set_color('red')
  #    format.set_align('center')
  #
  #    worksheet.write(4, 0, 'Hello', format)   # Formatted string
  #
  # The write() method will ignore empty strings or undef tokens unless a
  # format is also supplied. As such you needn't worry about special
  # handling for empty or undef values in your data. See also the
  # write_blank() method.
  #
  # One problem with the write() method is that occasionally data looks like a
  # number but you don't want it treated as a number. For example, zip codes or
  # ID numbers often start with a leading zero. If you write this data as a
  # number then the leading zero(s) will be stripped. You can change this
  # default behaviour by using the keep_leading_zeros() method. While this
  # property is in place any integers with leading zeros will be treated as
  # strings and the zeros will be preserved. See the keep_leading_zeros()
  # section for a full discussion of this issue.
  #
  # You can also add your own data handlers to the write() method using
  # add_write_handler().
  #
  # The write methods return:
  #
  #    0 for success.
  #   -1 for insufficient number of arguments.
  #   -2 for row or column out of bounds.
  #   -3 for string too long.

  # A blank cell is used to specify formatting without adding a string

  #
  # Excel differentiates between an "Empty" cell and a "Blank" cell. An
  # "Empty" cell is a cell which doesn't contain data whilst a "Blank" cell
  # is a cell which doesn't contain data but does contain formatting. Excel
  # stores "Blank" cells but ignores "Empty" cells.
  #

  # =FORMULAS AND FUNCTIONS IN EXCEL
  #
  # ==Caveats
  #
  # The first thing to note is that there are still some outstanding issues
  # with the implementation of formulas and functions:
  #
  #     1. Writing a formula is much slower than writing the equivalent string.
  #     2. You cannot use array constants, i.e. {1;2;3}, in functions.
  #     3. Unary minus isn't supported.
  #     4. Whitespace is not preserved around operators.
  #     5. Named ranges are not supported.
  #     6. Array formulas are not supported.
  #
  # However, these constraints will be removed in future versions. They are
  # here because of a trade-off between features and time. Also, it is possible
  # to work around issue 1 using the store_formula() and repeat_formula()
  # methods as described later in this section.
  #
  # ==Introduction
  #
  # The following is a brief introduction to formulas and functions in Excel
  # and WriteExcel.
  #
  # A formula is a string that begins with an equals sign:
  #
  #     '=A1+B1'
  #     '=AVERAGE(1, 2, 3)'
  #
  # The formula can contain numbers, strings, boolean values, cell references,
  # cell ranges and functions. Named ranges are not supported. Formulas should
  # be written as they appear in Excel, that is cells and functions must be
  # in uppercase.
  #
  # Cells in Excel are referenced using the A1 notation system where the column
  # is designated by a letter and the row by a number. Columns range from A to
  # IV i.e. 0 to 255, rows range from 1 to 65536.
  #
  # The Excel $ notation in cell references is also supported. This allows you
  # to specify whether a row or column is relative or absolute. This only has
  # an effect if the cell is copied. The following examples show relative and
  # absolute values.
  #
  #     '=A1'   # Column and row are relative
  #     '=$A1'  # Column is absolute and row is relative
  #     '=A$1'  # Column is relative and row is absolute
  #     '=$A$1' # Column and row are absolute
  #
  # Formulas can also refer to cells in other worksheets of the current
  # workbook. For example:
  #
  #     '=Sheet2!A1'
  #     '=Sheet2!A1:A5'
  #     '=Sheet2:Sheet3!A1'
  #     '=Sheet2:Sheet3!A1:A5'
  #     %q{='Test Data'!A1}
  #     %q{='Test Data1:Test Data2'!A1}
  #
  # The sheet reference and the cell reference are separated by ! the exclamation
  # mark symbol. If worksheet names contain spaces, commas o parentheses then
  # Excel requires that the name is enclosed in single quotes as shown in the
  # last two examples above. In order to avoid using a lot of escape characters
  # you can use the quote operator %q{} to protect the quotes. See perlop in
  # the main Perl documentation. Only valid sheet names that have been added
  # using the add_worksheet() method can be used in formulas. You cannot
  # reference external workbooks.
  #
  # The following table lists the operators that are available in Excel's
  # formulas. The majority of the operators are the same as Perl's,
  # differences are indicated:
  #
  #     Arithmetic operators:
  #     =====================
  #     Operator  Meaning                   Example
  #        +      Addition                  1+2
  #        -      Subtraction               2-1
  #        *      Multiplication            2*3
  #        /      Division                  1/4
  #        ^      Exponentiation            2^3      # Equivalent to **
  #        -      Unary minus               -(1+2)   # Not yet supported
  #        %      Percent (Not modulus)     13%      # Not supported, [1]
  #
  #
  #     Comparison operators:
  #     =====================
  #     Operator  Meaning                   Example
  #         =     Equal to                  A1 =  B1 # Equivalent to ==
  #         <>    Not equal to              A1 <> B1 # Equivalent to !=
  #         >     Greater than              A1 >  B1
  #         <     Less than                 A1 <  B1
  #         >=    Greater than or equal to  A1 >= B1
  #         <=    Less than or equal to     A1 <= B1
  #
  #
  #     String operator:
  #     ================
  #     Operator  Meaning                   Example
  #         &     Concatenation             "Hello " & "World!" # [2]
  #
  #
  #     Reference operators:
  #     ====================
  #     Operator  Meaning                   Example
  #         :     Range operator            A1:A4               # [3]
  #         ,     Union operator            SUM(1, 2+2, B3)     # [4]
  #
  #
  #     Notes:
  #     [1]: You can get a percentage with formatting and modulus with MOD().
  #     [2]: Equivalent to ("Hello " . "World!") in Perl.
  #     [3]: This range is equivalent to cells A1, A2, A3 and A4.
  #     [4]: The comma behaves like the list separator in Perl.
  #
  # The range and comma operators can have different symbols in non-English
  # versions of Excel. These will be supported in a later version of
  # WriteExcel. European users of Excel take note:
  #
  #     worksheet.write('A1', '=SUM(1; 2; 3)')  # Wrong!!
  #     worksheet.write('A1', '=SUM(1, 2, 3)')  # Okay
  #
  # The following table lists all of the core functions supported by Excel 5
  # and WriteExcel. Any additional functions that are available through the
  # "Analysis ToolPak" or other add-ins are not supported. These functions
  # have all been tested to verify that they work.

  # ==Improving performance when working with formulas
  #
  # Writing a large number of formulas with WriteExcel can be
  # slow. This is due to the fact that each formula has to be parsed and
  # with the current implementation this is computationally expensive.
  #
  # However, in a lot of cases the formulas that you write will be quite
  # similar, for example:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_formula('B1',    '=A1 * 3 + 50',    format)
  #     worksheet.write_formula('B2',    '=A2 * 3 + 50',    format)
  #     ...
  #     ...
  #     worksheet.write_formula('B99',   '=A999 * 3 + 50',  format)
  #     worksheet.write_formula('B1000', '=A1000 * 3 + 50', format)
  #
  # In this example the cell reference changes in iterations from A1 to A1000.
  # The parser treats this variable as a token and arranges it according to
  # predefined rules. However, since the parser is oblivious to the value of
  # the token, it is essentially performing the same calculation 1000 times.
  # This is inefficient.
  #
  # The way to avoid this inefficiency and thereby speed up the writing of
  # formulas is to parse the formula once and then repeatedly substitute
  # similar tokens.
  #
  # A formula can be parsed and stored via the store_formula() worksheet
  # method. You can then use the repeat_formula() method to substitute
  # _pattern_, _replace_ pairs in the stored formula:
  #
  #     formula = worksheet.store_formula('=A1 * 3 + 50')
  #
  #     (0...1000).each do |row|
  #        worksheet.repeat_formula(row, 1, formula, format, 'A1', 'A'.(row +1))
  #     end
  #
  # On an arbitrary test machine this method was 10 times faster than the
  # brute force method shown above.
  # --
  # For more information about how WriteExcel parses and stores formulas see
  # the WriteExcel::Formula man page.
  #
  # It should be noted however that the overall speed of direct formula
  # parsing will be improved in a future version.

  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('C1', cos, format, 'A1', 'A2')
  #
  # Although store_formula() is a worksheet method the return value can be used
  # in any worksheet:
  #
  #     now = worksheet.store_formula('=NOW()')
  #
  #     worksheet1.repeat_formula('B1', now)

  #
  # In many respects repeat_formula() behaves like write_formula() except that
  # it is significantly faster.
  #
  # The repeat_formula() method creates a new formula based on the pre-parsed
  # tokens returned by store_formula(). The new formula is generated by
  # substituting _pattern_, _replace_ pairs in the stored formula:
  #
  #     formula = worksheet.store_formula('=A1 * 3 + 50')
  #
  #     (0...100).each do |row|
  #       worksheet.repeat_formula(row, 1, formula, format, 'A1', "A#{row + 1}")
  #     end
  #
  # It should be noted that repeat_formula() doesn't modify the tokens. In the
  # above example the substitution is always made against the original token,
  # A1, which doesn't change.
  #
  # As usual, you can use undef if you don't wish to specify a format:
  #
  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('B2', formula, format, 'A1', 'A2')
  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('B3', formula, nil,    'A1', 'A3')
  #
  # The substitutions are made from left to right and you can use as many
  # pattern, replace pairs as you need. However, each substitution is made
  # only once:
  #
  #     formula = worksheet.store_formula('=A1 + A1')
  #
  #     # Gives '=B1 + A1'
  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('B1', formula, undef, 'A1', 'B1')
  #
  #     # Gives '=B1 + B1'
  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('B2', formula, undef, 'A1', 'B1', 'A1', 'B1')
  #
  # Since the pattern is interpolated each time that it is used it is worth
  # using the %q operator to quote the pattern. The qr operator is explained
  # in the perlop man page.
  #
  #     worksheet.repeat_formula('B1', formula, format, %q!A1!, 'A2')
  #
  # Care should be taken with the values that are substituted. The formula
  # returned by repeat_formula() contains several other tokens in addition to
  # those in the formula and these might also match the pattern that you are
  # trying to replace. In particular you should avoid substituting a single
  # 0, 1, 2 or 3.
  #
  # You should also be careful to avoid false matches. For example the following
  # snippet is meant to change the stored formula in steps
  # from =A1 + SIN(A1) to =A10 + SIN(A10).
  #
  #     formula = worksheet.store_formula('=A1 + SIN(A1)')
  #
  #     (1..10).each do |row|
  #       worksheet.repeat_formula(row -1, 1, formula, nil,
  #                                     'A1', "A#{row}",   #! Bad.
  #                                     'A1', "A#{row}"    #! Bad.
  #                               )
  #     end
  #
  # However it contains a bug. In the last iteration of the loop when row is
  # 10 the following substitutions will occur:
  #
  #     sub('A1', 'A10')    changes    =A1 + SIN(A1)     to    =A10 + SIN(A1)
  #     sub('A1', 'A10')    changes    =A10 + SIN(A1)    to    =A100 + SIN(A1) # !!
  #
  # The solution in this case is to use a more explicit match such as /(?!A1\d+)A1/:
  #
  #         worksheet.repeat_formula(row -1, 1, formula, nil,
  #                                     'A1', 'A' . row,
  #                                     /(?!A1\d+)A1/, 'A' . row

  #    array      = ['awk', 'gawk', 'mawk']

  #
  # The write_date_time() method can be used to write a date or time to the

  #
  #     worksheet.write_date_time('A1', '2004-05-13T23:20', date_format)
  #
  # The date_string should be in the following format:
  #
  #     yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss
  #
  # This conforms to an ISO8601 date but it should be noted that the full
  # range of ISO8601 formats are not supported.
  #
  # The following variations on the date_string parameter are permitted:
  #
  #     yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss         # Standard format
  #     yyyy-mm-ddT                     # No time
  #               Thh:mm:ss.sss         # No date

  #     yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss             # No fractional seconds
  #     yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm                # No seconds
  #
  # Note that the T is required in all cases.
  #
  # A date should always have a format, otherwise it will appear as a number,

  #     worksheet.write_date_time('A1', '2004-05-13T23:20', date_format)

  # Returns  0 : normal termination
  #         -1 : insufficient number of arguments
  #         -2 : row or column out of range
  #
  # The write_comment() method is used to add a comment to a cell. A cell
  # comment is indicated in Excel by a small red triangle in the upper
  # right-hand corner of the cell. Moving the cursor over the red triangle
  # will reveal the comment.
  #
  # The following example shows how to add a comment to a cell:
  #
  #     worksheet.write        (2, 2, 'Hello')
  #     worksheet.write_comment(2, 2, 'This is a comment.')
  #
  # As usual you can replace the row and column parameters with an A1 cell
  # reference. See the note about "Cell notation".
  #
  #     worksheet.write        ('C3', 'Hello')
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'This is a comment.')
  #
  # On systems with perl 5.8 and later the write_comment() method will also
  # handle strings in UTF-8 format.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', "\x{263a}")       # Smiley
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C4', 'Comment ca va?')
  #
  # In addition to the basic 3 argument form of write_comment() you can pass in
  # several optional key/value pairs to control the format of the comment.
  # For example:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :visible => 1, :author => 'Ruby')
  #
  # Most of these options are quite specific and in general the default comment
  # behaviour will be all that you need. However, should you need greater
  # control over the format of the cell comment the following options are
  # available:
  #
  #     :encoding
  #     :author
  #     :author_encoding
  #     :visible
  #     :x_scale
  #     :width
  #     :y_scale
  #     :height
  #     :color
  #     :start_cell
  #     :start_row
  #     :start_col
  #     :x_offset
  #     :y_offset
  #
  # Option: :encoding
  #
  #   This option is used to indicate that the comment string is encoded as
  #   UTF-16BE.
  #
  #     comment = [0x263a].pack('n')     # UTF-16BE Smiley symbol
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', comment, :encoding => 1)
  #
  # Option: :author
  #
  #   This option is used to indicate who the author of the comment is. Excel
  #   displays the author of the comment in the status bar at the bottom of
  #   the worksheet. This is usually of interest in corporate environments
  #   where several people might review and provide comments to a workbook.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Atonement', :author => 'Ian McEwan')
  #
  # Option: :author_encoding
  #
  #   This option is used to indicate that the author string is encoded as UTF-16BE.
  #
  # Option: :visible
  #
  #   This option is used to make a cell comment visible when the worksheet
  #   is opened. The default behaviour in Excel is that comments are initially
  #   hidden. However, it is also possible in Excel to make individual or all
  #   comments visible. In WriteExcel individual comments can be made visible
  #   as follows:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :visible => 1)
  #
  #   It is possible to make all comments in a worksheet visible using the show
  #   comments() worksheet method (see below). Alternatively, if all of the cell
  #   comments have been made visible you can hide individual comments:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :visible => 0)
  #
  # Option: :x_scale
  #
  #   This option is used to set the width of the cell comment box as a factor
  #   of the default width.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :x_scale => 2)
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C4', 'Hello', :x_scale => 4.2)
  #
  # Option: :width
  #
  #   This option is used to set the width of the cell comment box
  #   explicitly in pixels.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :width => 200)
  #
  # Option: :y_scale
  #
  #   This option is used to set the height of the cell comment box as a
  #   factor of the default height.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :y_scale => 2)
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C4', 'Hello', :y_scale => 4.2)
  #
  # Option: :height
  #
  #   This option is used to set the height of the cell comment box
  #   explicitly in pixels.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :height => 200)
  #
  # Option: :color
  #
  #   This option is used to set the background colour of cell comment box.
  #   You can use one of the named colours recognised by WriteExcel or a colour
  #   index. See "COLOURS IN EXCEL".
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :color => 'green')
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C4', 'Hello', :color => 0x35)    # Orange
  #
  # Option: :start_cell
  #
  #   This option is used to set the cell in which the comment will appear.
  #   By default Excel displays comments one cell to the right and one cell
  #   above the cell to which the comment relates. However, you can change
  #   this behaviour if you wish. In the following example the comment which
  #   would appear by default in cell D2 is moved to E2.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :start_cell => 'E2')
  #
  # Option: :start_row
  #
  #   This option is used to set the row in which the comment will appear.
  #   See the start_cell option above. The row is zero indexed.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :start_row => 0)
  #
  # Option: :start_col
  #
  #   This option is used to set the column in which the comment will appear.
  #   See the start_cell option above. The column is zero indexed.
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', 'Hello', :start_col => 4)
  #
  # Option: :x_offset
  #
  #   This option is used to change the x offset, in pixels, of a comment
  #   within a cell:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', comment, :x_offset => 30)
  #
  # Option: :y_offset
  #
  #   This option is used to change the y offset, in pixels, of a comment
  #   within a cell:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_comment('C3', comment, :x_offset => 30)
  #
  # You can apply as many of these options as you require.
  #
  # ==Note about row height and comments.
  #
  # If you specify the height of a row that contains a comment then WriteExcel
  # will adjust the height of the comment to maintain the default or user
  # specified dimensions. However, the height of a row can also be adjusted
  # automatically by Excel if the text wrap property is set or large fonts are
  # used in the cell. This means that the height of the row is unknown to
  # WriteExcel at run time and thus the comment box is stretched with the row.
  # Use the set_row() method to specify the row height explicitly and avoid
  # this problem.
  #
  def write_comment(*args)
    # Check for a cell reference in A1 notation and substitute row and column
    args = row_col_notation(args)

  #     worksheet.write_url('A5',  'mailto:bar@foo.com'            )
  #
  # There are two local URIs supported: internal: and external:. These are used
  # for hyperlinks to internal worksheet references or external workbook and
  # worksheet references:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_url('A6',  'internal:Sheet2!A1'                   )

  #     worksheet.write_url('A11', 'external:c:\temp\foo.xls#Sheet2!A1'   )
  #     worksheet.write_url('A12', 'external:..\..\..\foo.xls'            )
  #     worksheet.write_url('A13', 'external:..\..\..\foo.xls#Sheet2!A1'  )
  #     worksheet.write_url('A13', 'external:\\\\NETWORK\share\foo.xls'   )
  #
  # All of the these URI types are recognised by the write() method, see above.
  #
  # Worksheet references are typically of the form Sheet1!A1. You can also refer
  # to a worksheet range using the standard Excel notation: Sheet1!A1:B2.
  #
  # In external links the workbook and worksheet name must be separated by the
  # # character: external:Workbook.xls#Sheet1!A1'.
  #
  # You can also link to a named range in the target worksheet. For example say
  # you have a named range called my_name in the workbook c:\temp\foo.xls you
  # could link to it as follows:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_url('A14', 'external:c:\temp\foo.xls#my_name')
  #
  # Note, you cannot currently create named ranges with WriteExcel.
  #
  # Links to network files are also supported. MS/Novell Network files normally
  # begin with two back slashes as follows \\NETWORK\etc. In order to generate
  # this in a single or double quoted string you will have to escape the
  # backslashes, '\\\\NETWORK\etc'.
  #
  # If you are using double quote strings then you should be careful to escape
  # anything that looks like a metacharacter. Why can't I use "C:\temp\foo" in
  # DOS paths?.
  #
  # Finally, you can avoid most of these quoting problems by using forward
  # slashes. These are translated internally to backslashes:
  #
  #     worksheet.write_url('A14', "external:c:/temp/foo.xls"             )
  #     worksheet.write_url('A15', 'external://NETWORK/share/foo.xls'     )

  #

  #
  # This is the more general form of write_url(). It allows a hyperlink to be
  # written to a range of cells. This function also decides the type of hyperlink
  # to be written. These are either, Web (http, ftp, mailto), Internal
  # (Sheet1!A1) or external ('c:\temp\foo.xls#Sheet1!A1').
  #
  # See also write_url() above for a general description and return values.
  #
  # This method is essentially the same as the write_url() method described
  # above. The main difference is that you can specify a link for a range of
  # cells:

  #     worksheet.write_url('A4:D4',    'external:c:\temp\foo.xls'         )
  #
  # This method is generally only required when used in conjunction with merged

  # object, "CELL FORMATTING".
  #
  # There is no way to force this behaviour through the write() method.
  #

  #
  # you must call set_row() or set_column() before insert_image() if you wish
  # to change the default dimensions of any of the rows or columns that the
  # image occupies. The height of a row can also change if you use a font that
  # is larger than the default. This in turn will affect the scaling of your
  # image. To avoid this you should explicitly set the height of the row using
  # set_row() if it contains a font size that will change the row height.
  #
  # BMP images must be 24 bit, true colour, bitmaps. In general it is best to
  # avoid BMP images since they aren't compressed.
  #
  def insert_image(*args)

  # DATA VALIDATION
  #

  #
  # :call-seq:
  #    data_validation(row, col, params)
  #    data_validation(first_row, first_col, last_row, last_col, params)
  #
  # This method handles the interface to Excel data validation.
  # Somewhat ironically the this requires a lot of validation code since the
  # interface is flexible and covers a several types of data validation.
  #
  # We allow data validation to be called on one cell or a range of cells. The
  # hashref contains the validation parameters and must be the last param:
  #
  # Returns  0 : normal termination
  #         -1 : insufficient number of arguments
  #         -2 : row or column out of range
  #         -3 : incorrect parameter.
  #
  # The data_validation() method is used to construct an Excel data validation
  # or to limit the user input to a dropdown list of values.
  #
  #     worksheet.data_validation('B3',
  #         {
  #             :validate => 'integer',
  #             :criteria => '>',
  #             :value    => 100,
  #         })
  #
  #     worksheet.data_validation('B5:B9',
  #         {
  #             :validate => 'list',
  #             :value    => ['open', 'high', 'close'],
  #         })
  #
  # This method contains a lot of parameters and is described in detail in a
  # separate section "DATA VALIDATION IN EXCEL".
  #
  # See also the data_validate.rb program in the examples directory of the distro
  #
  # The data_validation() method is used to construct an Excel data validation.
  #
  # It can be applied to a single cell or a range of cells. You can pass 3
  # parameters such as (_row_, _col_, {...}) or 5 parameters such as
  # (_first_row_, _first_col_, _last_row_, _last_col_, {...}). You can also
  # use A1 style notation. For example:
  #
  #     worksheet.data_validation(0, 0,       {...})
  #     worksheet.data_validation(0, 0, 4, 1, {...})
  #
  #     # Which are the same as:
  #
  #     $worksheet.data_validation('A1',       {...})
  #     $worksheet.data_validation('A1:B5',    {...})
  #
  # See also the note about "Cell notation" for more information.
  #
  # The last parameter in data_validation() must be a hash ref containing the
  # parameters that describe the type and style of the data validation. The
  # allowable parameters are:
  #
  #     validate
  #     criteria
  #     value | minimum | source
  #     maximum
  #     ignore_blank
  #     dropdown
  #
  #     input_title
  #     input_message
  #     show_input
  #
  #     error_title
  #     error_message
  #     error_type
  #     show_error
  #
  # These parameters are explained in the following sections. Most of the
  # parameters are optional, however, you will generally require the three main
  # options validate, criteria and value.
  #
  #     worksheet.data_validation('B3',
  #         {
  #             :validate => 'integer',
  #             :criteria => '>',
  #             :value    => 100
  #         })
  #
  # The data_validation method returns:
  #
  #      0 for success.
  #     -1 for insufficient number of arguments.
  #     -2 for row or column out of bounds.
  #     -3 for incorrect parameter or value.
  #
  # ===validate
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The validate parameter is used to set the type of data that you wish to
  # validate. It is always required and it has no default value. Allowable
  # values are:
  #
  #     any
  #     integer
  #     decimal
  #     list
  #     date
  #     time
  #     length
  #     custom
  #
  # * any is used to specify that the type of data is unrestricted. This
  #   is the same as not applying a data validation. It is only provided for
  #   completeness and isn't used very often in the context of WriteExcel.
  #
  # * integer restricts the cell to integer values. Excel refers to this
  #   as 'whole number'.
  #
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 100,
  #
  # * decimal restricts the cell to decimal values.
  #
  #     :validate => 'decimal',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 38.6,
  #
  # * list restricts the cell to a set of user specified values. These
  #   can be passed in an array ref or as a cell range (named ranges aren't
  #   currently supported):
  #
  #     :validate => 'list',
  #     :value    => ['open', 'high', 'close'],
  #     # Or like this:
  #     :value    => 'B1:B3',
  #
  # Excel requires that range references are only to cells on the
  # same worksheet.
  #
  # * date restricts the cell to date values. Dates in Excel are expressed
  #   as integer values but you can also pass an ISO860 style string as used in
  #   write_date_time(). See also "DATES AND TIME IN EXCEL" for more information
  #   about working with Excel's dates.
  #
  #     :validate => 'date',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 39653, # 24 July 2008
  #     # Or like this:
  #     :value    => '2008-07-24T',
  #
  # * time restricts the cell to time values. Times in Excel are expressed
  #   as decimal values but you can also pass an ISO860 style string as used in
  #   write_date_time(). See also "DATES AND TIME IN EXCEL" for more information
  #   about working with Excel's times.
  #
  #     :validate => 'time',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 0.5, # Noon
  #     # Or like this:
  #     :value    => 'T12:00:00',
  #
  # * length restricts the cell data based on an integer string length.
  #   Excel refers to this as 'Text length'.
  #
  #     :validate => 'length',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 10,
  #
  # * custom restricts the cell based on an external Excel formula that
  #   returns a TRUE/FALSE value.
  #
  #     :validate => 'custom',
  #     :value    => '=IF(A10>B10,TRUE,FALSE)',
  #
  # ===criteria
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The criteria parameter is used to set the criteria by which the data in
  # the cell is validated. It is almost always required except for the list and
  # custom validate options. It has no default value. Allowable values are:
  #
  #     'between'
  #     'not between'
  #     'equal to'                  |  '=='  |  '='
  #     'not equal to'              |  '!='  |  '<>'
  #     'greater than'              |  '>'
  #     'less than'                 |  '<'
  #     'greater than or equal to'  |  '>='
  #     'less than or equal to'     |  '<='
  #
  # You can either use Excel's textual description strings, in the first
  # column above, or the more common operator alternatives. The following
  # are equivalent:
  #
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => 'greater than',
  #     :value    => 100,
  #
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 100,
  #
  # The list and custom validate options don't require a criteria. If you
  # specify one it will be ignored.
  #
  #     :validate => 'list',
  #     :value    => ['open', 'high', 'close'],
  #
  #     :validate => 'custom',
  #     :value    => '=IF(A10>B10,TRUE,FALSE)',
  #
  # ===value | minimum | source
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The value parameter is used to set the limiting value to which the criteria
  # is applied. It is always required and it has no default value. You can also
  # use the synonyms minimum or source to make the validation a little clearer
  # and closer to Excel's description of the parameter:
  #
  #     # Use 'value'
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => '>',
  #     :value    => 100,
  #
  #     # Use 'minimum'
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => 'between',
  #     :minimum  => 1,
  #     :maximum  => 100,
  #
  #     # Use 'source'
  #     :validate => 'list',
  #     :source   => 'B1:B3',
  #
  # ===maximum
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The maximum parameter is used to set the upper limiting value when the
  # criteria is either 'between' or 'not between':
  #
  #     :validate => 'integer',
  #     :criteria => 'between',
  #     :minimum  => 1,
  #     :maximum  => 100,
  #
  # ===ignore_blank
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The ignore_blank parameter is used to toggle on and off the
  # 'Ignore blank' option in the Excel data validation dialog. When the option
  # is on the data validation is not applied to blank data in the cell. It is
  # on by default.
  #
  #     :ignore_blank => 0,  # Turn the option off
  #
  # ===dropdown
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The dropdown parameter is used to toggle on and off the 'In-cell dropdown'
  # option in the Excel data validation dialog. When the option is on a
  # dropdown list will be shown for list validations. It is on by default.
  #
  #     :dropdown => 0,      # Turn the option off
  #
  # ===input_title
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The input_title parameter is used to set the title of the input message
  # that is displayed when a cell is entered. It has no default value and is
  # only displayed if the input message is displayed. See the input_message
  # parameter below.
  #
  #     :input_title   => 'This is the input title',
  #
  # The maximum title length is 32 characters. UTF8 strings are handled
  # automatically.
  #
  # ===input_message
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The input_message parameter is used to set the input message that is
  # displayed when a cell is entered. It has no default value.
  #
  #     :validate      => 'integer',
  #     :criteria      => 'between',
  #     :minimum       => 1,
  #     :maximum       => 100,
  #     :input_title   => 'Enter the applied discount:',
  #     :input_message => 'between 1 and 100',
  #
  # The message can be split over several lines using newlines, "\n" in double
  # quoted strings.
  #
  #     :input_message => "This is\na test.",
  #
  # The maximum message length is 255 characters. UTF8 strings are handled
  # automatically.
  #
  # ===show_input
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The show_input parameter is used to toggle on and off the 'Show input
  # message when cell is selected' option in the Excel data validation dialog.
  # When the option is off an input message is not displayed even if it has
  # been set using input_message. It is on by default.
  #
  #     :show_input => 0,      # Turn the option off
  #
  # ===error_title
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The error_title parameter is used to set the title of the error message
  # that is displayed when the data validation criteria is not met. The default
  # error title is 'Microsoft Excel'.
  #
  #     :error_title   => 'Input value is not valid',
  #
  # The maximum title length is 32 characters. UTF8 strings are handled
  # automatically.
  #
  # ===error_message
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The error_message parameter is used to set the error message that is
  # displayed when a cell is entered. The default error message is
  # "The value you entered is not valid.\nA user has restricted values that can
  # be entered into the cell.".
  #
  #     :validate      => 'integer',
  #     :criteria      => 'between',
  #     :minimum       => 1,
  #     :maximum       => 100,
  #     :error_title   => 'Input value is not valid',
  #     :error_message => 'It should be an integer between 1 and 100',
  #
  # The message can be split over several lines using newlines, "\n" in double
  # quoted strings.
  #
  #     :input_message => "This is\na test.",
  #
  # The maximum message length is 255 characters. UTF8 strings are handled
  # automatically.
  #
  # ===error_type
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The error_type parameter is used to specify the type of error dialog that
  # is displayed. There are 3 options:
  #
  #     'stop'
  #     'warning'
  #     'information'
  #
  # The default is 'stop'.
  #
  # ===show_error
  #
  # This parameter is passed in a hash ref to data_validation().
  #
  # The show_error parameter is used to toggle on and off the 'Show error alert
  # after invalid data is entered' option in the Excel data validation dialog.
  # When the option is off an error message is not displayed even if it has been
  # set using error_message. It is on by default.
  #
  #     :show_error => 0,      # Turn the option off
  #

  # Example of a bitmap that covers some of the area from cell A1 to cell B2.
  #
  # Based on the width and height of the bitmap we need to calculate 8 vars:
  #     $col_start, $row_start, $col_end, $row_end, $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2.
  # The width and height of the cells are also variable and have to be taken into

  # The values of $col_start and $row_start are passed in from the calling

  # Note about compatibility mode.
  #
  # Excel doesn't require every possible Biff record to be present in a file.
  # In particular if the indexing records INDEX, ROW and DBCELL aren't present
  # it just ignores the fact and reads the cells anyway. This is also true of
  # the EXTSST record. Gnumeric and OOo also take this approach. This allows
  # WriteExcel to ignore these records in order to minimise the amount of data
  # stored in memory. However, other third party applications that read Excel
  # files often expect these records to be present. In "compatibility mode"
  # WriteExcel writes these records and tries to be as close to an Excel
  # generated file as possible.
  #
  # This requires additional data to be stored in memory until the file is
  # about to be written. This incurs a memory and speed penalty and may not be
  # suitable for very large files.
